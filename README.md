# Recipe-Database-Application
The following application was developed to make use of a database developed in Oracle SQL Developer. My partners and I developed an application in Java which would allow us to make inquiries into the database, through implemented functionalities and methods, and return the appropriate data. The information which was stored in our database was recipes, gathered over the course of three months from the website Allrecipes.com, which we then extrapolated data to form a relational schema and ER diagram, which was then converted into the database. This data includes Authors, usernames for the website, serving size, ingredients, recipe names, etc.
