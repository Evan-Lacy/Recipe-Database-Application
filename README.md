# Recipe-Database-Application
The following application was developed to make use of a database developed in Oracle SQL Developer. My partners and I developed an application in Java which would allow us to make inquiries into the database, through implemented functionalities and methods, and return the appropriate data. 
-------------------------------------------
The information which was stored in our database was recipes, gathered over the course of three months from the website Allrecipes.com, which we then extrapolated data to form a relational schema and ER diagram, which was then converted into the database. 
-------------------------------------------
This data includes Authors, usernames for the website, serving size, ingredients, recipe names, etc., and all of this information was turned into an ER diagram which helped us model the database in Oracle. Once it was created, constraints were added to the tables within the database to create the relationships necessary for inquiries and commands, such as ORDER and SELECT. 
-------------------------------------------
Once the constraints and relations were formed between the tables, our group estalbished a set of guidelines by which the application was created.
